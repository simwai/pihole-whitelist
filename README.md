### Description
       
***whitelist.txt***       
This file contain domains that are safe to whitelist i.e it does not contain any tracking or advertising sites. Adding this file fixes many problems like YouTube watch history, videos on news sites and so on...

           
### Installation and Usage
        
***For Pi-hole in Docker installations***  
- First, make sure to clone the repository into a location that is accessible by your Pi-hole Docker' container, i.e. do a `git clone https://github.com/simwai/whitelist.git` in one of your volume mounts.  
- Next, make sure to make the script executable using `sudo chmod +x whitelist.sh`  
- Finally, setup a cronjob using `crontab -e` and add the following line:  
`0 0 * * * docker exec -d pihole '/opt/whitelist/scripts/whitelist.sh'`  

This will sync your whitelist with the one from the repository every day at midnight. Make sure to adjust the command to reflect your setup, i.e. change the container name and path to the script.  
         
***For native/normal Pi-hole installations***     
```
git clone https://github.com/anudeepND/whitelist.git
cd whitelist/scripts
sudo chmod +x whitelist.sh
sudo ./whitelist.sh
```

Note: You don't have to clone the repo every time you want to update whitelist file. Navigate to `whitelist/scripts` and run the script again `sudo ./whitelist.sh`

It's recommended to setup a cronjob to keep your whitelist in sync with the one from the repository. To do so, run `crontab -e` and add the following line: `0 0 * * * '/opt/whitelist/scripts/whitelist.sh'`  
This will sync your whitelist with the one from the repository every day at midnight. Make sure to adjust the path to where you cloned the script.  
  
### How do I determine an ad domain?
         
***Adam:ONE Assistant (Previously known as DNSthingy***
         
<a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/adamone-assistant/fdmpekabnlekabjlimjkfmdjajnddgpc">This browser extension</a> will list all of the domains that are queried when a web page is loaded. You can often look at the list of domains and cherry pick the ones that appear to be ad-serving domains.     
      
***Using inbuilt Developer tool***     
          
For Chrome ctrl+shift+I will land you in Developer tools menu.

***Using an Android app*** 
     
[Net Guard](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eu.faircode.netguard) is an Android app that can be used to monitor any specific apps, works on unrooted devices too.
